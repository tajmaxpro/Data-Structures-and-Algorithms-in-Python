    "## Like two pointers, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables with ordered elements. For the sake of brevity, the first part of this article up until the examples will be focusing on arrays. However, all the logic is identical for strings.

    "### Sliding window is another common approach to solving problems related to arrays. A sliding window is actually implemented using two pointers! First, let's start by looking at the concept of a subarray. Given an array, a subarray is just a section of the array. The elements need to be contiguous and in order. For example, with the array [1, 2, 3, 4], the subarrays (grouped by length) are:\n",

    "#### A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and end. For example, with [1, 2, 3, 4], the subarray [2, 3] has a starting index of 1 and an ending index of 2. Let's call the starting index the left bound and the ending index the right bound. Another name for subarray in this context is \"window\", which we will use from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the sliding window technique is to efficiently find the \"best\" window that fits some constraint. Usually, the problem description will define what makes a window \"better\" (shorter length, larger sum etc.) and the constraint. Imagine that a problem wanted the length of the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k for an array with positive numbers. In this case, the constraint is sum(window) <= k, and the longer the window, the better it is. The general algorithm behind sliding window is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a pointer for the left and right bound that represents the current window, usually both of them starting at 0.\n",
    "Iterate over the array with the right bound to \"add\" elements to the window.\n",

We need to tighten the window until the sum is below 8 again, which doesn't happen until our window looks like [7]. When we try to add the next element, our window again becomes too large, and we need to remove the 7 which means we have [4]. We can now grow the window until it looks like [4, 2, 1, 1], but adding the next element makes the sum too large.
